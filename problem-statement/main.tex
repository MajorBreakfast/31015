Problem statement
On autonomus or semi-autonomus multi-rotor vehicles you often have two
types of position sensors from which position can be inferred, a set of
sensors with fast update time that experience drift (accelerometers, rate
gyros), leading to unbounded error, and a set of absolute sensors with
slow update rates, but bounded error (GPS, ultrasound, the eyes of an
operator).
The slow sensors can thus correct for the drift of the fast sensors.

Autonomous or semi-autonomous multi-rotor vehicles are subject to the 
same localisation that apply to all autonomous systems, with the added
difficulty that it must be performed in 3 dimensions instead of only 
the 2 that ground based vehicles can move in. 

Localisation can be performed by using sensor measurements to infer
ones position. Sensors that work well for flying vehicles are accelerometers,
rate gyroscopes and magnetometers. Of these, only the magnetometer can provide
an absolute measure of position, but it is unuseable indoors or in any place
that has significant magnetic disturbances. A rate gyroscope measures the
rate of change of rotation around its axis and an accelerometer measures
acceleration, as its name implies. To obtain an absolute measure of position
from these devices, one must therefore integrate their outputs. This leads
to an unbounded error because the sensors are noisy. Other absolute measures 
of position, such as GPS, exist and have bounded errors, but very slow update
rates and thus do not lend themselves well to autonomous control. Luckily,
the aforementioned rate gyro and accelerometer have very fast update speeds.
Fusion of the fast sensors with unbounded error and the slow sensors with bounded
error can lead 


This project will be a study in methods for altitude control of a
simplified multi-rotor, a singe rotor on a lever. This will be done
through sensor fusion of fast, inaccurate sensors (e.g. MEMS
accelerometer) and slower sampled absolute sensors (e.g. IR distance
sensor). The results will be verified both in models and physical tests.

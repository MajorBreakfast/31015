\section*{Problem statement}
This project aims to answer the following questions
\begin{itemize}
	\item How can a MEMs accelerometer be stabilized using mechanical noise rejection methods?
	\item How can measurements from a MEMs accelerometer, a distance sensor 
		and a potentiometer be combined to deliver fast and accurate position updates
		using a software filter?
	\item How can the position of the system be controlled?
\end{itemize}

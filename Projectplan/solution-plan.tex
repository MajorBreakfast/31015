\section*{Solution Plan}

As the previously done work on the controller is a bit messy, the first step in solving the problem would be to clean up the old projet:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reverse engineer previous solution, refactor code
\item Reconfigure test setup, clean up wire mes
\end{itemize}

The problem with noise/uncertainty of the accelerometer has to be addressed, thus we have to
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigate source of noise in accelerometer
\item Investigate solutions for noise cancellation
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine if mechanical solution is enough, or
	\item Investigate possibility of using a digital filter, might require rework on communication interface
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The final part of solving the problem is designing the actual controller, for this we would need to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop / reconfigure model of system and controller to incorporate new accelerometer solution
	\item Investigate different controllers methodologies, and
	\item Implement one or more
\end{itemize} 

Finally we must verify that the controller actually works.

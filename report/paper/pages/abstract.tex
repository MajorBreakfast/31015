	Autonomous or semi-autonomous airborne robots must be able to perform localisation in three dimensions.
	We present a localisation system that estimates altitude, velocity and acceleration,
	using a MEMs accelerometer and rate gyroscope with high sample rates and proximity sensor with a low sample rate.
	Our implementation can update the state estimate at the high sample rate of the MEMs devices, while maintaining the accuracy
	of the slower proximity sensor for the position estimate. The estimate of the velocity and acceleration is greatly improved with
	higher sample rates. 
	The localisation is implemented using a kalman filter, and we combine it with
	with a linear quadratic regulator to control a simplified model of a multirotor; a lever arm with a rotor attached to one end.
	Using this method we high bandwidth, sub-centimeter control of the arm alitude.
	This project is a continuation of a previous bachelor thesis at DTU\@. It is intended as a stepping stone for control of a 
	fully autonomous multirotor vehicles. We provide a roadmap
	how the localisation system can be extended to handle localisation and control for a real multirotor in three dimensions.

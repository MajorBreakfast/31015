	Autonomous or semi-autonomous airborne robots must be able to perform localisation in three dimensions.
	We present a localisation system that estimates altitude at up to 1kHz within 1cm of the actual position,
	using a MEMs accelerometer, rate gyroscope and proximity sensor. We also implement an LQR controller for 
	a simplified model of a multirotor, a lever arm with propeller. In addition to providing a roadmap for
	how the localisation system can be extended to handle a real multirotor in three dimensions.

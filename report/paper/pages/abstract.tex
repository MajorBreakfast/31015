	Autonomous or semi-autonomous airborne robots must be able to perform localisation in three dimensions.
	We present a localisation system that estimates altitude, velocity and acceleration,
	using a MEMs accelerometer and rate gyroscope with high sample rates and proximity sensor with a low sample rate.
	Our implementation can update the state estimate at the high samplerate of the MEMs devices, while maintaining the accuracy
	of the slower proximity sensor for the position estimate, and much better accuracy for the velocity and acceleration estimate. 
	The localisation is implemented using a kalman filter and we combine it with
	with an LQR controller to control a simplified model of a multirotor, a lever arm with a rotor attached to one end,
	achieving sub-centimeter precision.
	This project is a continuation of a previous bachelor thesis at DTU\@. It is intended as a stepping stone for control of a 
	fully autonomous multirotor vehicles. We provide a roadmap
	how the localisation system can be extended to handle the real multirotor in three dimensions.

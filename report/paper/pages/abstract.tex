	Autonomous or semi-autonomous airborne robots must be able to perform localisation in three dimensions.
	We present a localisation system that estimates altitude, velocity and acceleration at up to 1kHz,
	using a MEMs accelerometer, rate gyroscope and proximity sensor. We use this localisation scheme together
	with an LQR controller to control a simplified model of a multirotor, a lever arm with a rotor attached to one end,
	achieving sub-centimeter precision.
	Lastly we provide a roadmap for 
	how the localisation system can be extended to handle a real multirotor in three dimensions.

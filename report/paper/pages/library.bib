abstract = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important
to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to
model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover,
it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from
the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to
changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal
and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking
problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are
sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle")
representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any
state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering
methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and
RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential
importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared
with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

abstract = {Sensor fusion is a method of integrating signals from multiple sources. It allows extracting information from several different sources to integrate them into single signal or information. In many cases sources of information are sensors or other devices that allow for perception or measurement of changing environment. Information received from multiple-sensors is processed using “sensor fusion” or “data fusion” algorithms. These algorithms can be classified into three different groups. First, fusion based on probabilistic models, second, fusion based on least-squares techniques and third, intelligent fusion. The probabilistic model methods are Bayesian reasoning, evidence theory, robust statistics, recursive operators. The least-squares techniques are Kalman filtering, optimal theory, regularization and uncertainty ellipsoids. The intelligent fusion methods are fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms. This paper will present three different methods of intelligent information fusion for different engineering applications. Chapter 2 is based on Sasiadek and Wang (2001) paper and presents an application of adaptive Kalman filtering to the problem of information fusion for guidance, navigation, and control. Chapter 3 is based on Sasiadek and Hartana (2000) and Chapter 4 on Sasiadek and Khe (2001) paper.},

abstract = {The spectrum sensing problem has gained new aspects with cognitive radio and opportunistic spectrum access concepts. It is one of the most challenging issues in cognitive radio systems. In this paper, a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio is presented. Various aspects of spectrum sensing problem are studied from a cognitive radio perspective and multi-dimensional spectrum sensing concept is introduced. Challenges associated with spectrum sensing are given and enabling spectrum sensing methods are reviewed. The paper explains the cooperative sensing concept and its various forms. External sensing algorithms and other alternative sensing methods are discussed. Furthermore, statistical modeling of network traffic and utilization of these models for prediction of primary user behavior is studied. Finally, sensing features of some current wireless standards are given.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio is viewed as a novel approach for improving the utilization of a precious natural resource: the radio electromagnetic spectrum. The cognitive radio, built on a software-defined radio, is defined as an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its environment and uses the methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and adapt to statistical variations in the input stimuli, with two primary objectives in mind: \&amp;middot; highly reliable communication whenever and wherever needed; \&amp;middot; efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. Following the discussion of interference temperature as a new metric for the quantification and management of interference, the paper addresses three fundamental cognitive tasks. 1) Radio-scene analysis. 2) Channel-state estimation and predictive modeling. 3) Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management. This work also discusses the emergent behavior of cognitive radio.},

@article{Welch2006,
abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

@article{Burges1998,
abstract = {The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

@article{Madgwick2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel orientation algorithm designed to support a computationally efficient, wearable inertial human motion tracking system for rehabilitation applications. It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; < 0.8° static RMS error, < 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},
